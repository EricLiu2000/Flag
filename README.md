# Flag
The goal for this flag project was to make a scalable United States flag. This fulfills the project specification, as I have made a United States flag that scales based on a slider. There are no current errors with my project. My code is broken up into the Main class, the Flag class, and the Star class. The flag is drawn when the main method inside the Main class calls the constructor of Flag. The drawing of the Stars is left to the Star class, which creates a scaling star at a given point. The flag class creates fifty instances of this class using for loops. One major challenge in creating this code was the creation of the stars. I encountered problems in creating the proper points for the stars and in scaling these stars. I had help on the stars from Alvin On.
